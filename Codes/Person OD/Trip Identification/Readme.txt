Trips are the unit of analysis for almost all transportation applications. Traditional data sources such as travel surveys include trip-level information. The mobile device location data, on the other hand, do not directly include trip information. Location sightings can be continuously recorded while a device moves, stops, stays static, or starts a new trip. These changes in status are not recorded in the raw data. As a result, researchers must rely on trip identification algorithms to extract trip information from the raw data. Basically, researchers must identify which location points form a trip together.

This R script checks relationships between consecutive points of a device to identify which points belong to the same trip. The code uses point files and adds a column of trip ID to the point file based on a set of rules that identify which points belong to the same trip.
